I'm a second year Ph.D. Candidate from [Institute for Computer System Architecture](https://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/icsa) of [School of Informatics](https://informatics.ed.ac.uk/), [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/). My research interest includes quantum computing architecture, quantum EDA and fault-tolerant quantum computing.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Antonio Barbalace](https://www.barbalace.it/antonio/) and [Dr. Raul Garcia-Patron](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=EmnabekAAAAJ&hl=en) from the University of Edinburgh. Prior to this, I worked with [Dr. Shengyu Zhang](http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~syzhang/) and [Dr. Yi-Cong Zheng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=6Eo-JGEAAAAJ&hl=en) as a research intern at the Tencent Quantum Lab.
